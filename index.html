								<p>My Journey:<br> </p> Precision as a Path<br>
Some people are born with a clear-cut path For me, the road was built step by step, through experiences, challenges, and listening to my inner voice to find where I truly belong.<br>
The Navy — Responsibility on the Front Line<br>
I served in the Israeli Navy as a Coastal Observer (Bakshit) at Zikim, on the Gaza border. It was an intense period defined by responsibility, alertness, and precision with no room for error. There, I learned the critical importance of attention to detail, teamwork, and the understanding that my every action impacted something much larger than myself.<br>
From Strauss Coffee — To Quality Control<br>
After my service, I began working as a Machine Operator at Strauss Coffee, where I was also responsible for quality control. The work was technical, requiring discipline and accuracy—ensuring everything functioned perfectly and that every product leaving the line was flawless. This is where my meticulous nature took root: checking, understanding, and never stopping until I was certain everything was correct.<br>
The Hair Industry — Craftsmanship without Passion.<br>
Later, I became an entrepreneur in the hair industry:<br> specializing in chemical straightening. It was a profession that demanded delicacy, patience, and a steady hand—traits that reflect who I am. But something was missing. I was working, but I wasn't feeling the spark. I realized I needed a path that sparked curiosity and meaning, not just a job.
The Turning Point — Discovering Software Systems:<br>
Today, I work as an Assistant Parking Manager, where I am also responsible for managing the parking facility's software. Suddenly, I discovered the fascination of understanding how systems work behind the scenes: what makes things run, what happens when a glitch occurs, and how to optimize processes.
That was the moment the light turned on.
<br> QA — Where Meticulousness Becomes an Asset<br>
This journey led me to the decision to study Manual and Automation QA. This field allows me to: 
Deeply investigate systems.
Understand what happens behind the screen.
Identify issues before they ever reach the user.
Turn my precision and "pedantic" nature into a professional superpower.
For me, QA isn't just "another profession." It is the perfect fusion of responsibility, critical thinking, curiosity, and a genuine love for the small details.
I am still on my journey, still learning and building my path—but today, I am in a place that feels right. Every milestone—the military, the factory, my time as an entrepreneur—has become a stepping stone leading me to where I am meant to be.</p>
